    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.
      It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
      Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.
